# particle-programmer-shield

A set of scripts to configure a machine to use the [Particle Programmer Shield](https://github.com/spark/shields/tree/master/photon-shields/programmer-shield) for repeatable OpenOCD Particle firmware programming.

Though this is a Chef cookbook, much of the basic configuration is done with bash scriptsin [/files/default/install_scripts](/files/default/install_scripts).

Chef functionality will come later once we're using this setup for Continuous Integration...
